Go places is a web app based on Google App Engine.
The web app can be found at this address: [http://go-places-ucsb.appspot.com](http://go-places-ucsb.appspot.com)

Briefly, the idea is to customize a route between two places. Say you wanna drive from Santa Barbara to Mexico.
On the way, you'd like to stop at a pet park and visit a natural history museum. You may also want to stop a night at some pet friendly resort. So how do you find a route that would have all these provisions? 

That's what this application is supposed to give you; routes customized to your preferences.
