3. Testing using cURL (_curl_commands.sh_)

    **Note**: Some cURL commands have been commented out in the script. These require certain input from the user before they     can be run. More directions can be found in the comments.

    To run script, make sure the permissions to execute _curl_commands.sh_ are set. Use _chmod_ to set them, if required.

    Run script `./curl_commands.sh`
